# Node engine server

## Installation

First you need to install Node.js, if you haven't already:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

The Node Package Manager ( npm ) comes with Node.js, but this is not necessarily the latest version ( npm gets updated more regularly than Node.js ). It is better to upgrade npm to the latest version. For this open a console ( command prompt ) window and type:

npm install npm@latest -g

Now you are ready for installing nodeserv. At the same console window type:

npm install -g nodeserv

## Running the program

Open a console window and type:

nodeserv

Then navigate your browser to:

localhost:9000
